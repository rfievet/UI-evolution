    <!--
    How This Works:
    - AngularJS introduces two-way data binding (`ng-model`).
    - The `ng-app` directive bootstraps the AngularJS application.
    - The `ng-controller` directive binds the controller logic to the page.
    - The `{{ name }}` syntax automatically updates when the input changes.

    Limitations:
    - Performance issues due to the way AngularJS tracks changes.
    - Complex applications can become slow as the number of bindings increases.
    - Learning curve: Requires understanding directives, scopes, and dependency injection.
    - Harder to debug due to complex digest cycles.

    What the Next Tech (React) Solved:
    - Virtual DOM: Improved performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.
    - Component-based architecture: Encouraged modular, reusable UI elements.
    - Unidirectional data flow: Made state management more predictable.

        var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
        app.controller("MyController", function ($scope) {
            $scope.name = "World";
