    <!--
    How This Works:
    - This page is a basic HTML document with static content.
    - It consists of a title, a heading, and a paragraph.
    - No styling, layout control, or interactivity.

    Limitations:
    - No styling: Everything looks plain and unformatted.
    - No interactivity: Users cannot interact with the page beyond reading content.
    - No layout control: Elements stack in the order they appear in the document.

    What the Next Tech (CSS) Solved:
    - Introduced styling (colors, fonts, spacing) for better presentation.
    - Enabled layout control (positioning, alignment, responsiveness).
    - Allowed separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), making code more maintainable.
