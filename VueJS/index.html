        How This Works:
        - Vue introduces a simple, reactive data-binding system (`v-model`).
        - The `data` object manages the application state.
        - Changes to the input field automatically update the UI without direct DOM manipulation.

        Fixes Over jQuery:
        - Eliminates direct DOM manipulation by using a declarative approach.
        - Provides two-way data binding (`v-model`) for syncing input with state.
        - Encourages component-based architecture (though not mandatory like in React).

        Fixes Over React (Class Components Era):
        - Easier syntax and a gentler learning curve compared to JSX in React.
        - No need for extra build tools like Babel for basic use.
        - Simpler state management without needing external libraries like Redux.

        Limitations:
        - Two-way data binding can become hard to track in large applications.
        - Lacked flexibility for advanced state management (later improved with Vue Composition API).
        - Vue 2 relied heavily on Options API, which could become verbose in complex apps.

        What the Next Tech (Vue Composition API, React Hooks) Solved:
        - Vue Composition API (2020) made state management and logic reuse more flexible.
        - React Hooks (2019) eliminated the need for class components, making state easier to manage.
