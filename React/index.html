        How This Works:
        - React introduces a component-based architecture.
        - `useState` is used for managing state, eliminating the need for direct DOM manipulation.
        - The `onChange` event updates the state and triggers re-rendering automatically.
        - Virtual DOM optimizes updates by only changing what's necessary.

        Fixes Over jQuery:
        - Eliminates the need for direct DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById` in JavaScript, `$("#id")` in jQuery).
        - Improves performance with a Virtual DOM that minimizes re-renders.
        - Introduces a declarative approach: UI updates are automatically handled based on state.
        - Encourages modular, reusable components.

        Limitations:
        - JSX introduces a learning curve (mixes HTML-like syntax with JavaScript).
        - Requires a build process (Babel, Webpack) for modern React development.
        - State management can get complex in large applications (later solved by Redux, Context API).

        What the Next Tech (React Hooks, Vue Composition API) Solved:
        - React Hooks (2019) eliminated the need for class components, making state management more straightforward.
        - Vue Composition API (2020) improved reactivity and logic reuse within Vue applications.

                    <input type="text" onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
