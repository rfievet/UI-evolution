        /* 
        How This Works:
        - CSS is used to style the page by adding colors, fonts, and layout improvements.
        - The `body` rule sets the font and background color.
        - The `h1` rule changes the text color of the heading.

        Fixes Over Plain HTML:
        - Allowed separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS).
        - Introduced design elements like colors, fonts, and positioning.
        - Enabled better readability and aesthetic improvements.

        Limitations:
        - No interactivity: Users still cannot interact with the page.
        - No dynamic content: Text and layout remain static.
        - Required inline styles or `<style>` blocks in the HTML file (later solved by external CSS files).

        What the Next Tech (JavaScript) Solved:
        - Added interactivity, allowing elements to change dynamically.
        - Enabled event handling (clicks, hovers, etc.).
        - Introduced dynamic updates without reloading the page.
